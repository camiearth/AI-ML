# Digit Recognition Deep Learning Project

This project aims to create a deep neural network for digit recognition using MATLAB.

## Dataset
- Training Dataset: `digittrain_dataset.mat`
- Testing Dataset: `digittest_dataset.mat`

## Tasks

1. **Task 1**: Train the first autoencoder.
2. **Task 2**: Train the second autoencoder using the output of the first autoencoder.
3. **Task 3**: Train a softmax layer.
4. **Task 4**: Construct a deep neural network with the first autoencoder, second autoencoder, and softmax layer.
5. **Task 5**: Evaluate the performance of the deep network.
6. **Task 6**: Retrain the deep network and evaluate performance again.

## Results

- Performance of the deep network: 0.23
- Performance of the deep network after retraining: 0.14

## Usage
- Make sure to have MATLAB installed with the Deep Learning Toolbox.

## Instructions
1. Load the dataset.
2. Run the script step by step to complete each task.
3. Refer to the README for dataset details, tasks, and results.
