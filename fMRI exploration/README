## fMRI Overview
## Python

This Jupyter Notebook contains tasks related to brain anatomy and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis. It explores topics such as anatomical scans, fMRI data, regressors, and signal fitting.

## Contents
1. **Task 1**: Brain Anatomy and Voxel Calculation
   - Calculate the number of voxels in an anatomical scan with specific dimensions and resolution.

2. **Task 2**: fMRI Data Analysis
   - Answer questions about a 4-D fMRI recording, including the number of scans, voxel count, and datapoints.

3. **Task 3**: BOLD Response Analysis
   - Utilize the `nilearn.glm.first_level.compute_regressor` function to compute the expected BOLD response for given events.

4. **Task 4**: Regressor Correlations
   - Construct regressors for conditions 'A' and 'B' based on event onset times, amplitudes, and durations.
   - Compute correlations of these regressors with a provided signal to determine the best-fitting condition.
