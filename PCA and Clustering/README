# Principal Component Analysis and Clustering Exercises
# MATLAB

This repository contains the code for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering on various datasets.

## Section 1: Principal Component Analysis

### Exercise 1.1.2: Implementing PCA from Scratch
- Standardize the variables to have zero mean and unit variance.

### Exercise 1.3: Application to Face Image Data

#### Exercise 1.3.1: Dimensionality Reduction for Face Images
- Load the dataset faces.mat containing 5000 grayscale face images.
- Normalize the dataset to have zero mean.
- Run PCA to obtain principal components.
- Project the face dataset onto the first 100 principal components.
- Recover the data and compare the first 100 reconstructed faces to the original ones.

## Section 2: Clustering - Application to Cardiac Data

### Exercise 2.1: Extracting Features

#### Exercise 2.1.1: Loading and Visualizing Cardiac Data
- Load the cardiac data from cardiacShapes.mat, including myocardial centerline data and subgroup labels.
- Visualize the myocardial shapes for all subjects.
- Extract relevant features such as curve length, shape area, and curvature.
- Plot features against each other to identify potential data clusters.

### Exercise 2.2: Clustering

#### Exercise 2.2.1: Implementing K-means Algorithm
- Implement the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch.
- Cluster the data into two clusters.
- Evaluate the results using the label data.

This repository provides MATLAB scripts to perform these exercises. Feel free to explore, modify, and analyze the datasets using the provided code. Enjoy the exercises and the insights you'll gain from them!
